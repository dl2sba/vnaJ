    <h2>
      Usage
    </h2>
    <p>
      This dialog can be used i.e. to tune an antenna filter to a given centre frequency and a defined band-width.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marker-math dialog is bound to one of the markers. The data displayed in this dialog is the data of this
      marker.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Mode
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mode used depends on the data at the selected cursor location.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the data left and right of the cursor is lower, than
      <b>
        PEAK-mode
      </b>
      is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the data left and right of the cursor is higher, than
      <b>
        NOTCH-mode
      </b>
      is selected.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Limit
    </h2>
    <p>
      A limit in dB must be defined, which is used to search for the low- and high-limits.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Return-/Transmission-Loss
    </h2>
    <p>
      If the marker should use the Return-Loss scale, the RL-radio button must be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the marker should use the Transmission-Loss scale, the TL-radio button must be selected.
    </p>

      Sample - tune a bandpass-filter
    </h2>
    <p>
      Assume you want to tune a BP to a 6dB-bandwidth of 100kHz ...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      <p>
        Set one of the markers to the desired center-frequency of the bandpass-filter
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
      Enter 6 in the
      <b>
        Limit
      </b>
      field.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
    Now tune the filter until the desired bandwidth of 100kHz is displayed in the
    <b>
      Bandwidth-field
    </b>
    .
  </p>
</li>
</ol>
