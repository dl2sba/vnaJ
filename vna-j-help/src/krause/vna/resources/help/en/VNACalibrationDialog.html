	<h1>Help on Calibration</h1>
	<p>There are four diagram areas on this dialog. Depending of the
		selected mode and analyzer type, one or more diagram areas are enabled
		for usage.</p>
	<p>For every visible diagram, a measurement must be made to create
		a valid main calibration dataset. When all the required calibration
		data has been created, the SAVE button gets enabled and the UPATE
		button receives a green background to indicate, that a complete main
		calibration dataset is now recorded.</p>
	<p>The created main calibration dataset can now be used in the
		application by simply pressing the UPDATE button, which will also
		close the dialog. If one or more curves do not match the expectations
		simply rerun the needed calibration by pressing the button below the
		diagram again.</p>
	<p>When closing the dialog using the UPDATE button, the calibration
		status in the status bar is updated.</p>
	<h2>Overscan</h2>
	<p>To get smoother scans when the measured object s resistance is
		near one of the calibration references (means i.e. the measured
		resistance is 50Ohm real which is identical with the reference value
		50Ohm) an over scan feature was added.</p>
	<p>In the calibration dialog exists an input field , where the
		number of scans can be entered. This number of scans is executed when
		the readXXX button is pressed. The calibration curve used is the
		arithmetic mean of all scans executed. The higher the number, the
		smoother the calibration data is.</p>
	<h3>Remark</h3>
	<p>The time needed to create a i.e. 5x over scan is about 5 times
		the duration needed for a 1x over scan. The resulting calibration data
		file contains no information how many over scans where used during
		creation</p>
	<h2>Scan mode</h2>
	<p>Starting with release 2.8.5d of vna/J there are two modes for
		the calibration.
	<h3>Mode 1</h3>
	<p>Depending on the analyzer type, the maximum scan range of the
		analyzer is divided into 1 or more ranges with different number of
		calibration steps. This results in enhanced resolution in these scan
		ranges.
	<p>
	<h3>Mode 2</h3>
	<p>This mode uses a fixed number of calibration steps in maximum
		scan range of the analyzer. For some analyzer types, the number of
		steps can be changed in the driver info dialog.</p>
	<h3>User-definedy</h3>
	<p>These scan ranges can be changed by the user by editing a simple
		text file. The driver specific text-file is created when the
		calibration dialog is first opened. The filename depends on the
		short-name of the driver. The file is located in the preset directory
		of vna/J. The text-file must contain lines with exactly this format:</p>
	<p>[start-frequency]blank[stop-frequency]blank[number of
		steps]blank[#overscan]</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The frequency must be within the range of the driver. You can
			check the minimum and maximum frequency in the driver info dialog.
			The frequency values must be in Hertz.</li>
		<li>The ranges must cover the complete frequency range of the
			driver.</li>
		<li>The number of steps must be within the range of 10 and
			30.000.</li>
		<li>The number of overscan must be between 1 and 10</li>
		<li>The ranges must be listed in ascending order</li>
		<li>The ranges must contain no gaps and no overlap</li>

	</ul>
	<h3>Sample for miniVNApro</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>100000 999999 4000 1</li>
		<li>1000000 9999999 4000 1</li>
		<li>10000000 29999999 10000 1</li>
		<li>30000000 200000000 10000 1</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Sample for miniVNA tiny</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1000000 30999999 10000 2</li>
		<li>31000000 3000000000 10000 1</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Hint</h3>
	<p>If you get stuck in using these user-defined scan ranges, simply
		delete the corresponding file in the preset folder of vna/J</p>
