      Firmware info

    <p>
      If the analyzer is connected and configured to the correct communication port, the version of the internal
      firmware is displayed. Else an error message is shown.

    <h3>
      Powerstatus

    <p>
      If the analyzer is connected and configured to the correct communication port, the currently voltage of the internal battery is displayed.

      #calibration steps
    </h3>
    <p>
      Determine the number of steps used during creation of calibration data. A value of 2.000 gives for most of the use
      cases good results. The resolution of one calibration step is the scanrange 100kHz to 200MHz divided by 2.000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasing this number results in a smaller frequency range per calibration point. Increasing the number of
      calibration points only slows down the calibration data creation, not the regular scans.
    </p>
    <h3>
      DDS ticks per MHz
    </h3>
    <p>
      The value entered here depends on the analyzers internal DDS clock frequency. Only a very little number of
      analysers have a 500MHz DDS. All later analyszers have a 520MHz DDS. The DDS frequency is usually on the backside
      label of the analyzer.

    <ul>
      <li>
      For a 500MHz DDS use the value 8589934
    </li>
    <li>
    For a 520MHz DDS use the value 8259552.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  for a fine frequency calibration please use the frequency calibration function in vna/J.

      Firmware revision
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since version 2.3 of the miniVNApro firmware, the analyser supports any scan widths. 
      Prior to this version, the scan widths must me a multiple of 100.
      If your analyser has a firmware >= 2.3 (see info in Firmware info field) check the ">=2.3" checkbox.  
    </p>
    <p>
		Since version 2.3 of the miniVNApro firmware, it is also possible to 
		reduce the generator power by 6dB in transmission mode, to overcome the problem 
		with little bit too high generator power. This will reduce the dynamic 
		range in transmission mode by 6dB to abt. 84dB.
		If the box "Fixed 6dB" is checked, the generator power is reduced by 6dB. 
		<em>The calibration files must be regenerated and should not be mixed with 
		regular calibration files.</em>

<h3>
  Open timeout
</h3>
<p>
  The time in milliseconds between the open request to the interface and the response from the interface. If this time
  is exceeded, an error is thrown. Should be usually not changed!
</p>
<h3>
  Command delay
</h3>
<p>
  The time in milliseconds between the commands send to the analyzer. Should be usually not changed!
</p>
<h3>
  Read timeout
</h3>
<p>
  The time in milliseconds between the command request to the analyzer and the response from the analyzer. If this time
  is exceeded, an error is thrown. Should be usually not changed!
</p>
<h3>
  Baudrate
</h3>
<p>
  The baudrate used to communicate with the analzer. Should be usually not changed!
</p>
<h3>
  Reference resistance
</h3>
<p>
  All internal calculations are done using the entered reference resistance. It can be a complex value with real and
  imaginary parts. Usually only 50+i0 is entered.
