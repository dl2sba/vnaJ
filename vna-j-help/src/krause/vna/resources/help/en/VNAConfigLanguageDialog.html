	<h1>Help on language selection</h1>
	<p>Use this dialog to configure the language settings of vna/J.</p>
	<p>Usually vna/J tries to determine the locale of the computer it
		runs. Sometimes it may be necessary to switch to another language. If
		vna/J is used on a computer, whose language is not supported by vna/J,
		the default language English is selected.</p>
	<p>Based on the language settings, i.e. formatting of numbers is
		done as defined by this language.</p>
	<p>After changing the language settings inside vna/J an application
		restart is necessary.</p>
	<p>vna/J currently is translated into the languages for which a
		radio button exists in the dialog.</p>
