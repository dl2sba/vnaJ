    <h1>
      Setup-Scales dialog
    </h1>
    <p>In this dialog the user can define the scale ranges for the Rs, Xs, |Z| and RSS scale.</p> 
	<p>The ranges of the scales RL, TL, RP, TP cannot be changed here, because the absolute ranges are determined by the used analyzer.</p>
	<p>Idea is, that the user defines the scale ranges for his usual measurement tasks. When he resets the scale range using the "Custom-scale dialog", the minimum and maximum values are set to values entered in this dialog.</p>
	<p>The values in brackets are the absolute maximum or minimum values for this field.</p>
	<p>There is no further validity checking on this dialog, so be careful. If you get stuck, simply delete the vna/J configuration file.</p>
	<p>Clicking the SAVE button, save the ranges to the corresponding scales.</p>
